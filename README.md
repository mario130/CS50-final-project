# CS50-final-project

### What's the project?
For my final project in CS50, I created this memory game which is basically the classic memory game but the faces of cards are the technologies used in front end development.

### Languages used
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Game features
It has some basic features like:
* Keeping track of how many wrong guesses a user tried.
* Inputting your name which I plan to use later with cookies to save each player's high score to the browser.
